# UAV Smart Agri-Assistant using Machine Learning Models
This paper illustrate
how an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle loaded with sensors is used to
collect data, analyze it and perform certain tasks, once done by
a human, by the machine and help the overall agriculture system
to yield a better quality and quantity of production. We aim to
make the agriculture system optimal and minimize the human
input to save time and make more educated.

# DataSet
