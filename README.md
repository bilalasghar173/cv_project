# UAV Smart Agri-Assistant using Machine Learning Models
This paper illustrate
how an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle loaded with sensors is used to
collect data, analyze it and perform certain tasks, once done by
a human, by the machine and help the overall agriculture system
to yield a better quality and quantity of production. We aim to
make the agriculture system optimal and minimize the human
input to save time and make more educated.

# DataSet
The Dataset consists of two directories called diseased and healthy. DataSet can be found <a href="https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset/tree/master/raw/color">here</a>.<br />

# Flow of Code
1: Load Original Image <br />
2: Convert image from RGB to BGR <br />
3: Convert  image from BGR to HSV <br />
4: Image Segmentation <br />
5: Global Feature Descriptor. <br />
6: Training Models

# Accuracy
75%
